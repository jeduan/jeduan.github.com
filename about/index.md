Hi! I'm a developer from Mexico City.

My last job was as CTO of [Yogome](http://yogome.com), a 500-backed startup in the educational mobile games industry. I'm pretty proud of [several](https://github.com/jeduan/modeloespecial.lua) [Lua libraries](https://github.com/jeduan/corona-offlinequeue) [I made](https://github.com/jeduan/corona-analytics-mixpanel) [there](https://github.com/jeduan/grunt-multiresize) and a server in node with services supporting the games.

Also, I organize with [a friend](http://twitter.com/siedrix) the [local BeerJS chapter](http://chelajs.com).
