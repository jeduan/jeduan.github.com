<p class="subtitle">Hi! I'm a web developer from Mexico City, glad you stopped by</p>

I'm an active member of Mexico City's growing startup ecosystem. I've worked with [Nuflick][nuflick] on the past and also worked on several hackathons.

Right now there's not much to show on this site, but meanwhile you can check out the code I've released on [my github][gh]. I'm interested on web development on Ruby and Javascript, and right now I'm toying with CoffeeScript and iOS Development.
